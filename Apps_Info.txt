    + app_06 => Dictionary, List, Tuple, Set, These Types Built-in Functions
    + app_07 => Numeric data types Buit-in Functions
    + app_08 => A Project to calculate factorail and sum of a list of number, for loop, range()
    + app_09 => More exercise about while loops
    + app_10 => Learning functions deeply, More exercise on dictionaries and lists
    - app_11 => A simple project and a simple game to review all concepts we worked till now
    - app_12 => Working on files in Python

Phase 2) in this phase we work on python syntax and statements deeply
